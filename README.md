# DisWebCord
A simple Discord.js code testing tool (not ment for hosting) for Discord bots.

### Why?
Evaluating code on a production bot is not so smart, so I made this tool to quickly test stuff right in the browser without creating any files or clutter.

### Features
- Multiple versions (11.2.1, 11.3.1, 11.4.2, master, more can be added if needed)
- Saving and Loading
- Console on the page
- JavaScript eval tool and editor with syntax highlighting
- Customizable, all variables can be accessed from the editor and eval box
